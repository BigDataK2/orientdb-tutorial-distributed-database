# orientdb-tutorial-distributed-database

In this Tutorial we will setup a Distributed Database with Docker Containers. 

On the OrientDB Manual Sites are already the basics good explained, to understand how a distributed System works.
http://orientdb.com/docs/2.0/orientdb.wiki/Distributed-Architecture.html   
To understand and learn this better we will implement an example with which you can play around. This helps you to understand and test the capabilities and the limits of such a distributed Database.

For setting up some DB-Servers on the same sub-network, are many possibilities for example using virtual machines. In This Tutorial we will use Docker, because it will not generate so much Overhead as an fully virtualized Operating-System. 
In a Docker-Container only the needed processes are running, so there is not so much computing capacity needed comparing to use some virtual-machines.

If you have never heard about docker, or if you interested, read the well made doc's on https://docs.docker.com/.
