# Tests
Now can make some Test for example:

### - kill one server an show if it continuous to work.

Before you kill e.g. usa add some records to the usa cluster.<br/>
Now can stop a server (here usa) with the terminal command:
    
    docker stop usa
    
and restart it with

    docker start usa
    
    
are the usa-records still available? why? Look at the distributed configuration.
