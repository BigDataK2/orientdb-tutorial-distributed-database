1. limitation of access (answer time)
1. availability and redundancy of data

DDBMS are installed on multiple servers and 


If the amount of requests increases, then with Horizontal Scalability of DDBMS by adding an additional Server can be quick responding to changes. 

have the advantage  


















horizontal skalierbar auf Ã¤nderungen reagieren 
multimalster
redundace




Der vorteil von VerDBMS liegt in dyn skalierung
