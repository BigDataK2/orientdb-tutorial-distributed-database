In today's world processing of Big data takes an important role.

For managing and storing this big amount of data is more than a single database necessary. Due to this reason distributed database systems have been developed.
DDBMS (distributed database management systems) are used if a "Single DBMS" reaches its limits. Reasons for this are:


1. The volume of data is to big, so it can't stored on a single DBMS 
1. The DBMS can't process the big size of user requests in an acceptable time.
1. availability and redundancy of data



DDBMS are installed on multiple servers and have the


If the amount of requests increases, then with Horizontal Scalability of DDBMS by adding an additional Server can be quick responding to changes.
