With docker it is possible to package a application with all needed dependencies.
 
In this Tutorial we will use the official OrientDB package (image) from https://hub.docker.com/r/orientdb/orientdb/

To run a application with Docker you first have to install the Docker-Deamon. Meanwhile there are additional tools for managing docker applications. They are not necessary for this Tutorial.
To install the deamon follow the steps on:
